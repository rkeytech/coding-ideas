# coding-ideas
A repo just to keep track of some ideas for programming projects. I'll try to open an issue for every project I want to create, comment about different resources that I'll use in it and maybe keep a project journal for every one of them so anyone can try to make them on their own.

## WIP
I've got a wordpress instance up and running. I'll try to convert it into a blog/log type of thing so I can make posts about my progress in these projects. Projects will be seperated in categories so anyone can sort out other posts and keep only the posts from the project he/she wants.
