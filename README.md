# Coding Ideas
A repo just to keep track of some ideas for programming projects. I'll try to open an issue for every project I want to create, comment about different resources that I'll use in it and maybe keep a project journal for every one of them so anyone can try to make them on their own.

## Ideas
- [ ] Create a magento project on Ubuntu 20.04 and NGINX Web Server.
- [ ] Create a Bootstrap 5 portfolio with HTML, CSS and some basic Javascript.
